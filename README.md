Simple CLI written by Swift to check the health status of Git providers such as Github, GitLab, Bitbucket. Supporting macOS & Linux, not yet tested on Windows but it should work as well. This repo is still being developed, feel free to contribute ðŸ’–

## Installation
[Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint) is designed to be used with Swift command line tools that build with the Swift Package Manager. It makes installing, running and distributing these tools much easier.

```
$ mint install SwiftCLI/git-status
```

## Usage
```
$ git-status --bitbucket
```

## Checklist
These are some pending tasks should be developed, your contributions are appriciated!
- [ ] Support more providers: Github, Gitlab.
- [ ] Add an option to check & notify to Chat apps: Slack, Google Chat, ...
- [ ] Relace [Data(contentsOf:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/1413892-init) method by using a cross-platform network manager client instead.
- [ ] Implement uint test cases.

## Tech stacks
I'm a fan of Reactive Programming, currently working on [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) & [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine). Even though RxSwift is already cross-platform but Combine. I give a try to use an open-source version of Apple Combine: [OpenCombine](https://github.com/OpenCombine/OpenCombine).

## Limitations
Currently, [Swift Core Libraries](https://swift.org/core-libraries/) not yet fully support for Linux, therefore we can't use [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) to make network requests. I'm working around by using [Data(contentsOf:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/1413892-init) method instead. It looks urgly but no choice!
